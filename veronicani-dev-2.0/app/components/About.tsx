        <p>
          I'm a multi-disciplinary front-end software engineer and designer,
          with a 5+ year background in illustration, creative advertising,
          motion graphics, and mobile games. Currently working with the Live
          Music Project.

        <p>
          I'm here to bridge the gap between engineering and design needs during
          a product's development cycle, and contribute to products with a
          design-first methodology to deliver impeccable user experiences.

          Director at Black Math, Inc.
